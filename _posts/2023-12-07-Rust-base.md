## Rust base (where to start ?)

As a rustling myself, i have spent time understanding the basic concepts of rust. 

**Rust** is a modern, systems-level programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. It was designed to address the shortcomings of other languages by providing a powerful combination of performance and memory safety.

Key features of Rust include:

- **Safety**: Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector. It prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferencing, data races, and memory leaks at compile time.

- **Performance**: Rust offers high performance similar to languages like C and C++. It achieves this by providing low-level control over memory while still ensuring safety.

- **Concurrency**: Rust supports concurrent programming, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously without data races or deadlocks, thanks to its ownership and borrowing rules.

- **Expressive Syntax**: Its syntax is expressive and ergonomic, making it easy to write clean and readable code. Rust promotes modern programming practices and provides powerful abstractions.

- **Community and Ecosystem**: Rust has a vibrant and welcoming community. It offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that developers can use to build various applications, from system-level software to web applications and more.

### Some of the things to set in motion.

**Step 1**: Basics of Rust Syntax

- **Variables and Data Types:**
Learn how to declare variables using let and understand different **data types** like integers, floats, booleans, and characters.

- **Control Flow**:
 Understand control flow structures (if, else, loop, while, for) to control the execution of your code based on conditions.

**Step 2**: Functions and Error Handling

- **Functions**:
Dive into functions by learning how to define, call, and pass parameters to functions. Explore returning values from functions.
Error Handling:

- Learn about Result and Option types for error handling. Understand how to handle errors using match and unwrap.

**Step 3**: Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes

- **Ownership Rules**:
Understand Rust's ownership system, including ownership rules and how it affects variables and memory management.
Borrowing:

- Explore borrowing rules, such as one mutable reference or multiple immutable references, and how it ensures memory safety.

**Step 4**: Advanced Concepts

- **Structs and Enums**:
Learn about structs and enums, which allow you to create custom data types with different variations.

- **Traits and Generics**:
Understand traits (similar to interfaces in other languages) and generics (writing code that works with multiple types) to write flexible and reusable code.

**Step 5**: Practical Application

- **Project-Based Learning**:
Apply what you've learned by working on small projects or coding exercises. Create simple command-line utilities, basic games, or data processing tools using Rust.
Explore Libraries and Documentation:

- Explore Rust's ecosystem and popular libraries like serde for serialization, actix-web for web development, or tokio for asynchronous programming. Dive into their documentation to understand their usage.

**Step 6**: Practice and Community Engagement

- **Practice Regularly**:
Regularly practice writing Rust code to reinforce your understanding and improve your skills.
Engage with the Community:

- Participate in Rust forums, communities (like Rust Users Forum, Reddit's r/rust), and consider contributing to open-source Rust projects. Engaging with the community can help you learn and grow faster.


Make a plan on how to approach these concepts and within no time you can be a rustling yourself.
