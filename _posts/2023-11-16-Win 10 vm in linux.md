## Setting Win 10 vm on Pop_OS!

Windows dual boot seriously kills ! unless you have a dedicated SSD for it and seperate one for your real OS, or you love spywares and backdoors. After setting up Pop os as daily-driver (beginner friendly) you can enjoy windows and destroy the VM whenever you want.

>Here, we are setting up Win 10 since win11 is not that speedy for me (i tried "potato is still potato" ) also some personal reasons (will do after an upgrade) in a Kernel-based virtual machine (KVM) using QEMU.
