## Starting with Rust ?

Recently, I was going through many guides and tutorials to 
have a good understanding of rust for some projects to be yet,
cooked. I thought "why not just write leave a few trails behind..

### Why Rust ?

Rust is cool : due to these reasons crabs are sexy -- **Rust** is used for 
three essential purposes in programming; **performance**, **safety**, and 
**memory management** ,also control freaks love these combo. From 
experience I tried It and there is no BS straight legit " If the code is 
perfect it will work" straight to the every detail. Long story short I was 
once learning C from scratch and at some point I loved the process but 
later on hated It. maybe i was bored or had little resources back in the 
day.. but this looks promising.

### How to start and where ?

Ok, so the materials here took some time but was worth it..
if i am about to start from begining.. will probably start from [**here**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/rust-introduction/1-introduction) 

This short tour will give you an idea 
also check out [rust-official-book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) 

If you are more of a tutorial guy just
go for it after that come back practise your skills [here](https://play.rust-lang.org) which is Rust playground to run your [code](https://play.rust-lang.org/help) and try out..

I have some other materials aswell
just **checkout**.

[**Rusty-exercises**](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises)

[**Rusty-cookbook**](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/)

[Rusty-ext1](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust) other materials will be also updated, 
based on beginner friendly nature.

### Preparing environment for Rust programming


If you got this covered then no problem but if excited to try out:

### Install

Just go to [Rust-official](https://www.rust-lang.org) click that get started 
button and you are good to go, everything 
is there buddy..

### ENV

Setting vscodium with some plugins maybe 
fine for your average use.
plugins : rust-analyzer, CodeLLDB, Better TOML

you can add even more and make a big bloat.

For the best experience i will suggest [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rust/installation-guide.html#silent) by Jetbrains. The IDE dedicated for rust.


### Other 

join the r/rust community on reddit if you 
are a reddit guy or you can check out rust 
forums aswell.
