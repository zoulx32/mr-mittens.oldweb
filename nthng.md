"Hello there 😼

I'm `Mittens`, a self-taught tech-enthusiast, programmer, and data analyst. Learning, creating, researching, 
and delving into the world of data analytics is my passion. I am a staunch advocate of decentralization, privacy, security
and free software. My studies have primarily revolved around Operating Systems, Penetration Testing, and Networking 
and I thrive on solving security challenges within these domains.
Some of the standout aspects of my expertise lies in decentralized networks like Tor, Operating systems, Finding
alternatives for bloated consumer tech & Data privacy.
