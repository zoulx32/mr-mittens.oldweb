~ $ Hello there ðŸ˜¼

I'm `Mittens`, a self-taught tech-enthusiast, programmer and data analyst. Learning, creating,
researching and delving into the world of data science is my passion.
I am a staunch advocate of decentralization, privacy, security and free software.
My studies have primarily revolved around Operating Systems, Penetration Testing and 
Networking and I thrive on solving security challenges within these domains.
Some of the standout aspects of my expertise lies in decentralized networks like Tor & P2P.
Operating systems [ studying operating systems, or a system in general], FOSS [Finding alternatives
for bloated consumer tech] & Data privacy.
