~ $ Hello there ðŸ˜¼

I'm Mittens, a self-taught tech enthusiast, programmer, and data analyst with a focus on data science. I'm passionate about decentralization, privacy, security, and free software. My expertise lies in operating systems, penetration testing, and networking. I enjoy solving security challenges and exploring decentralized networks like Tor and I2P. Studying operating systems, finding alternatives in FOSS, and prioritizing data privacy are my key pursuits.
