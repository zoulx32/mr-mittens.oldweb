~ $ Hello there ðŸ˜¼

I'm Mittens, a self-taught tech-enthusiast, programmer and data analyst.
Learning, creating,researching and delving into the world of data science
is cool for me. im a staunch advocate of decentralization, privacy,
security and free software. My studies have primarily revolved around
Operating Systems, Penetration Testing & Networking .I thrive on solving security challenges
within these domains.decentralized networks like Tor & I2P are still a rant subject for me.
Operating systems [ studying operating systems, or a system in general], FOSS [Finding alternatives
for bloated consumer tech] & Data privacy are other things that i do.
